                        *Slightly Spicy...*

Chill Chili Studio is an indy team of video games developers borned from a university project of the Degree in Videogames Design and Development at CITM-UPC and is a team formed by 7 students with different knowledge in different areas (art, design, programming…). This is not the first project that our team members have done together, some of us has been working together before with good results.
Towards the project, our main objective is to make a dynamic game in which the player has to think the strategy to survive as long as it cans, arriving at the end if possible. Our surface intention is to make players return to their most precious memories by doing a game based on Command and Conquer: Red Alert 2 and to make the player feel satisfied after his correct strategy think.
